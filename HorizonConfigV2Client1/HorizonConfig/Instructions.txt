You need to have a file called 
"LastDataBaseName.txt"

which you can leave completely empty. 

You also need a file called 
"DatabaseConnectionClient.txt"
which must be in the following format:

<Your instance of SQL Server name, e.g. DQMX1VC-Desktop\SQLEXPRESS>
<your username>
<your password>
<Cloud server ip address connection details (ask Andy for these unless you know it)>
<our default username>
<our default password>
